            Our second group maker project presented the challenge of creating something that relates to a current social issue of today. Upon drawing on our own knowledge of social issues, as well as a little research, we narrowed down the possibilities to one group; poverty and food insecurity.
<br><br>
With users to focus on and a context to research, we did some research for ideas and to get a better understanding of our users and their struggles. This is when a group member came across micro-gardens, tiny indoor vegetable gardens that can be harvested to eat. We based our prototype on this idea. 
<br><br>
At our next meeting after deciding on a topic, a couple group members had already come up with ideas for our design. The first was a mesh tower with many shelves that would be placed by a window. This would be adjustable in size to fit the spatial needs of the user. The other idea was an extendable pole and board that could fit in a window as a shelf to place plants on. In the end, we decided to go with the shelf idea, as we thought it would allow for more sunlight to reach the plants, as well as be better at fitting spatial needs. 
<br><br>
When designing our final prototype, I made a digital ideal version, while a groupmate made the physical version. Due to the restrictions in place from the pandemic, we were unable to meet up and share materials, so a digital prototype was a way to show how we would have made the physical product had we been able to collaborate in person.
<br><br>
Overall, our design consisted of stackable shelves with supports that could adjust to any size window. This adjustable platform was the unique aspect we came up with using our research and collaborative discussion, and it ultimately received good feedback from our presentation audience. We also created a paper guide to setting up the shelf, as well as how to take care of the plants. We made an app version of this as well, based on feedback from our instructor, and we hope to further iterate this in the future!
<h2>My Angle</h2>
<br><br><br><br><br>
Throughout this project, I wanted to focus on the unique aspect of our design. Since micro-gardens already do exist, I thought it was crucial to adapt the idea in our own unique way in the context of our social issue. The government of Canada states, “in larger Saskatchewan cities to be approximately $10 000 per year, leaving little money for other living expenses for those in the lower income brackets.” (Wanda 2019.) With this evidence, it’s crucial to provide alternative and cheaper ways to get healthy food, which personal gardening is also described as helping with. Therefore, with these facts, we can be certain that this is an issue, and that by making the most out of the extra space one has, we can ensure our product is unique to our issue and will have a positive impact on those we are trying to help.
<br><br>
An aspect of the project I am interested in improving in future iterations would be the app. As of our final prototype, it was solely another platform to read the guide. But, I believe it has the potential to become a great way to make the product more accessible, by providing options for different fonts, audio instructions etc.
