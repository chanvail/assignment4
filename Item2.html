For our first Maker Lab group project (GMP1), we were tasked with hacking a box. When our group thought about which kind of box we had the most ideas for, and which could be most useful for a variety of people, we decided on takeout boxes. 
<br><br>
We started out creating individual sketches of how we thought the box could be redesigned. While each varied greatly, we mostly created ideas based on carrying multiple boxes at a time and keeping food warm. With these as our core ideas, we combined our best elements from each sketch into a final prototype while also considering accessibility and functionality. 
<br><br>
This final prototype was built by a group member, made from cardboard she would have otherwise thrown away, tape and aluminum foil for insulation. 
<br><br>
With our final prototype made, we started thinking about how we could further improve it to become better in the situation we faced with the pandemic, where takeout was on the rise due to the inability to eat out in restaurants. We decided to research some eco-friendly alternatives to our materials, and came across cedar wrap for insulation. (5 Green Alternatives to Aluminum And Tin Foil, 2020) Although this does not work exactly the same as tin foil, it is biodegradable and is used to retain heat in food individually.
<br><br>
We finished off oru project by presenting it to the class, during which we got feedback from real users, who mentioned how they would use the box we created, and how it could benefit them in their specific situations, such as commuting, carrying a large quantity of boxes etc.

When creating our individual sketches, I wanted to prioritize accessibility. I designed the boxes to easily detach without to much effort needed using a latching system, I added entirely removable lids which not only would be easy to remove in a variety of directions and ways, but would also help with the environmental aspect by reducing the water needed to do dishes, as users could easily eat out of the box itself. 
  <br>  <br>
The environmental aspect is also extremely important for this project in my eyes. Since takeout container usage is on the rise, more and more will be thrown out or not able to be recycled, which—at this scale—could massively contribute to climate change. If we were to further iterate on this project, which I hope to do, I’d do more research on sustainable materials to ensure we have the most eco-friendly product we could have. 
<br>  <br>
I believe these areas of focus could greatly impact takeout in a positive way, allowing for more people to use it, while also reducing the consequences of having more people use it. I hope to further iterate this idea, as the feedback we got on it was positive and showed interest in it, despite only being a rough first prototype.
