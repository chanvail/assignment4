            <p>Hi! My name is Chantal and I am a second year UX Design student at Wilfrid Laurier University. In addition to my major, I am also pursuing a minor in psychology and a specialization in game design and development. 
            <br>   
            <br>My interest in UX stems from a love of graphic design. While working on my skills throughout high school, I learned about Laurier's UX program, and was inspired by the work. My hope for my work is to help change the world and help different people around the world.
            <br>
            <br>I also love to snowboard, waterski and write novels in my spare time.
