                This project, the quarantine companion, is an app that allows users to gain valuable insights about their social habits, exercise and time management in the largely unstructured world we find ourselves in when in lockdown. 
<br>
<br>
From the personal experience of our group members in lockdown, we discussed how lockdown has affected us in terms of the healthy habits we would normally have. We all related in terms of how in an unstructured environment and unchanging environment, it’s hard to keep track of activities and keep ourselves motivated to keep in touch with others. So, we designed an app to help with these challenges.
<br>
<br>
We first interviewed a variety of different participants who have experienced lockdown, and from their answers, we created an empathy map and persona to guide our design. With these in mind, we individually created wireframes to present to the group, where we combined them to make our first prototype. 
<br>
<br>
With this prototype, we went through multiple rounds of testing (including wizard of oz testing and think-aloud testing) and reiterated our design until we had a revised medium fidelity prototype that took into account the feedback from our users. 
<br>
<br>
This prototype included a home page with quick insights and links, an insights page where users could go more in-depth into their stats, an input page where users could add their data and a calendar app, which users could use to look back at their activity per day. Along with a couple other pages (settings, profile, login), our app is functional in figma!
<br>
<br>
In the end, not only is our prototype useful for users in lockdown, but can also be used in everyday life to gain insights in a busy world. In the future, I hope our group could further iterate the app and develop it into a fully working design!
<h2>My Angle</h2>
<p>
    When making this project, we wanted to help people’s mental health and connections with others during lockdown. In our research, we found out that many people live alone, limiting one’s connection with others (US Census Bureau, 2019). This can cause people to feel isolated and alone. Personally with this project, I wanted to give users a bit of guidance and support when they are forced to remain isolated in an unmotivating unchanging environment. Throughout my summer in lockdown, I felt disconnected from my friends, my sleep schedule was all over the place and I wasn’t motivated to exercise. If I were to have an app that could tell me exactly how little I was doing the things that were important, I would have been motivated to increase my activity. In this project, I was sure to include these aspects in our app, since they were also supported by our interview responses as being big struggles in many peoples’ lives.
